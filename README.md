For Part 1, as we are reading .JSON file so I am using JavaScript to complete this task.<br>
To run the code,<br>
- Both the .json and .js files should be in the same directory
- To run, in a terminal type, node part01.js
- We can change the input by changing the inputs variable in the part01.js file

To run the code,<br>
- I am using Eclipse
